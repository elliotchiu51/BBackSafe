## Mission Statement

Assault is a criminal offence in Canada with serious consequences. There are various types of assaults, each with its own set of consequences. In recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the number of police-reported assault cases across the country. Police-reported crime in Toronto, measured by the Toronto Police Service, increased 25% from 16,807 cases in 2014 to 21,092 cases in 2019. Low-income Canadians are more likely than higher-income Canadians to report socially disruptive conditions in their neighbourhoods. The socially disruptive conditions reported by low-income Canadians may reflect levels of crime in their neighbourhoods. Furthermore, low-income Canadians expressed greater fear or concern in specific situations such as walking alone at night in their neighbourhood, using public transportation after dark, and being at home alone at night. People in vulnerable positions and are in vulnerable groups (i.e. women and children), are more likely to come across an assault. In 2015, the United Nations established Sustainable Development Goal 10, “Reduce inequality within and among countries”, to ensure in reducing inequalities within vulnerable groups by 2030. 

This app explores on the Sustainable Development Goal 10, Reducing Inequalities, and how the rates of crime in certain areas of Toronto can allow a user to be aware of these hotspots in order to avoid in becoming the next victim. Identifying areas of risk helps to better plan preventive interventions in the area of assault especially for women and children. Evidence suggests that inequality between men and women in a household is a significant contributor to societal income inequality. Gender inequalities affect women and girls' income as well as other aspects of their well-being (Indicator 10.3.1). Furthermore, children are more likely than adults to be poor, and their youth makes them more vulnerable to the effects of poverty. With children accounting for a big portion of Toronto’s population, a clear focus on children is critical to permanently ending poverty (Indicator 10.2.1). 

With the data from the Public Safety Data Portal, this application generates custom routes that avoid areas of high crime. The user is able to identify all areas of assault as well as areas of higher rates of assault to promote public awareness and prevent future victims. Anyone can be assaulted during his or her lifetime, therefore, BBackhome ensures safety among the citizens of Toronto especially those who are most vulnerable.
