She first became interested in GIS when she attended a spatial talk webinar series hosted by Wo-Men Geospatial Coterie (WGC) where they discussed about opportunities and challenges for women in geospatial sciences. She hopes in the future to be able to further expand her own knowledge in the field of Natural Sciences and integrate it using geospatial technologies. In her spare time, you can catch her hanging out with friends and family, playing sports like volleyball and tennis, taking on spontaneous adventures and travel.
